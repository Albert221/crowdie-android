# Crowdie - so you won't lose anyone!

Crowdie is an Android application dedicated for groups of people who want to know each other's location.

Are you with your family or friends and want to split for a while? Are you in a crowded place and are afraid of losing rest of your folks from your eyes? Crowdie is for you!

## Features

#### Ease of use

All you need to do to create a new room is press one button and let others scan the QR code from your phone.

#### Real-time tracking

Crowdie shows you the exact location of all members of your group along with their distance to you.

#### Simple roles hierarchy

There is an *admin* and just a *member*. Admin can kick others from the room and also receives notifications if anyone is too far or sends a WAIT! message.

## Technical stuff

Crowdie uses an API exposed by its [server](https://github.com/Albert221/crowdie-server). It is on its way to start using WebSockets for communication. More details in the server's repository README.

## Goal of the project

I've created this project mainly to learn Android development using Kotlin and MVP pattern with Dagger and Retrofit. I've learnt alot with it.

I've abandoned this project, but it's in its good way to become a finished, usable app. There are still many bugs, some of which are documented in the Issues.
